# Industrial Activity Data Collection at TU Wien
## Overview
This repository is part of a collaborative project at TU Wien aimed at building a comprehensive dataset of industrial activities. Utilizing M5StickC Plus devices, we collect precise gyroscopic and accelerometer data to capture a wide range of industrial motions and activities.

## Project Components
- Server Script: A Python-based server script for data collection from connected M5StickC Plus devices.

- Client Program: Code running on M5StickC Plus devices to gather and send gyro and accelerometer data to the server.

- Data Analysis Notebook: A Jupyter Notebook for preliminary analysis of the data quality and characteristics.

## Objectives

- Collect high-fidelity motion data in industrial settings.

- Ensure the reliability and accuracy of data for use in broader research on industrial processes.

- Contribute to the development of a robust dataset for academic and research purposes at TU Wien.

##  Getting Started
- Set up the server by running the provided Python script on a suitable machine.
- Load the client program onto M5StickC Plus devices and connect them to the server.
- Collect data during various industrial activities and upload it to this repository.
- Use the Jupyter Notebook for initial data analysis and share your findings.
